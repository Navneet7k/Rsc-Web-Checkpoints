# Rsc-Web-Checkpoints
RSC web is an experimental approach to make seamless transfer of interactive text between your pc and smartphone. 

Some of the features offered by RSC includes :

* allows you to pin important notes to the top of the list.

* RSC remembers your last read location of the note and automatically scrolls to that position when you return to that note. You may also manually add bookmarks to your note.
